# week_6.py
# This week we are going over functions.
# Functions allow us to break our code into reusable chunks.
# This allows us to reuse pieces of code and write cleaner code if done right.

import random
# This is how you define a function
def test_function():
    print("This is my test function running.")

def print_name():
    print("My name is Allen")

def main():
    # Let's call the new function we made.
    test_function()

    # Let's call the function print_name
    print_name()
